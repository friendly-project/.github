# Welcome to the friendly! project

We're aiming to create user-friendly and intuitive experiences for users across various platforms, displays, and input methods.

Right now, we're working on [Doclint](https://github.com/friendly-project/doclint), a set of standards for writing technical documentation in user-friendly ways.
